# new-file-folder
Basic folders for my site and sadly, the site is in progress.

# NOTE:
We will not put my site near in Github, 
due to several attempts, so we can go to a basic site builder by eachother,
go down the example.

# { Example }:
My own site's assets (HTML, CSS, JS) will go on Neocities.org,
cause they only suported styled files like (HTML, CSS, JS) and etc.

# { Example 2 }:
The other assets (which is on folders) will go on Github,
cause my folders only suported some files that does not go on
Neocities.org.
